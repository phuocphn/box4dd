# Manual checklist

The app layer (panels, drag-and-drop, hotkey, menu bar) is checked by hand. Build and launch with:

```sh
scripts/bundle.sh && open build/box4dd.app
```

Each slice adds its own section. Run all sections before closing a slice.

## Slice 1: Basic Shelf (#2)

- [ ] The app shows only a menu bar icon: no Dock icon, and it's not in ⌘Tab
- [ ] Menu bar icon → Quit box4dd quits the app
- [ ] ⌃⌥Space opens an empty Shelf under the cursor ("Drop files here")
- [ ] ⌃⌥Space again opens a second Shelf; both stay open
- [ ] Menu bar icon → New Shelf opens a Shelf too
- [ ] With TextEdit in front and typing, ⌃⌥Space opens a Shelf and TextEdit keeps focus (you can keep typing)
- [ ] The Shelf stays above TextEdit when you click TextEdit
- [ ] Switch Space (⌃→): the Shelf is still visible
- [ ] Put Safari in full screen: ⌃⌥Space opens a Shelf over it
- [ ] Dragging the Shelf's top strip moves it (empty Shelves also move by dragging anywhere)
- [ ] Drag 3 Finder files onto a Shelf: it highlights while hovering, then shows a pile of icons and "3 items"
- [ ] No files are copied: the originals are still where they were, and there are no new files anywhere
- [ ] Drag the Items from the Shelf to the Desktop (same volume): the files **move** there, and the Shelf closes because it's empty
- [ ] Drop files on a Shelf, then drag them out to a USB drive or other volume: the files are **copied**, and the Shelf closes
- [ ] Drop files on a Shelf, drag them out holding ⌥ onto a folder on the same volume: the files are **copied**
- [ ] Drop files on a Shelf, start dragging them out, then press Esc or drop back on the same Shelf: the Items stay
- [ ] Drag Items from one Shelf onto another: they move to the second Shelf, and the first closes
- [ ] The close button on a Shelf with Items closes it, and the original files are untouched
- [ ] Drag Items from a Shelf onto the Trash: the drop is refused, and the Items and originals stay
- [ ] Click a Shelf while typing in TextEdit: keystrokes still go to TextEdit
